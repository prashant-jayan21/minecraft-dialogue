<Builder> hey
<Architect> hi
<Architect> ready?
<Builder> yup
<Architect> okay here we go
<Architect> so we will be building what looks like a bell
<Architect> with supports...
<Architect> pick up 8 red blocks first
<Builder> now what?
<Architect> stack them up anywhere but closer to some edge
<Builder> all in one column?
<Builder> hello?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> good
<Architect> now do the same with green blocks
<Builder> should it be along the opposite edge?
<Architect> not exactly
<Architect> it should be 7 spaces apart from this red column
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> christmas colors
<Architect> no no no
<Architect> 7 spaces apart
<Builder> what
<Architect> that's 6 spaces apart
<Builder> i said "here?" and you said yes!
<Builder> wtf
<Architect> ya i assumed you knew what "apart" meant :P
<Builder> but before that i asked if it should be along the opposite edge
<Builder> like it is for the first edge
<Builder> but you said not exactly so i assumed not the same
<Architect> ya because it need not be along the edge strictly...
<Architect> anyway...
<Builder> yeah but similarly to how the red one already is
<Architect> let's move on
<Builder> basically theyre' both 1 block from their respective edges
<Architect> place a purple block on each of those towers
<Architect> and then connect them with a purple row
<Architect> nice
<Architect> those are the supports i meant
<Builder> yeah, i see it
<Builder> so what next? yellow blocks?
<Architect> orange
<Builder> orange bell...... ok
<Architect> lots of them
<Builder> whatever you say man
<Builder> i've picked up as many as i can hold
<Architect> place the first one right below the center of the purple row
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now a 3 block row below it
<Builder> row oriented the same way as the purple row?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> do the same again
<Architect> and then a 5 block row
<Architect> now pick up a yellow block
<Architect> can you guess where it goes?
<Builder> wow!
<Architect> awesome!
<Architect> good job yo!
<Builder> bells are not fat
<Builder> i mean flat
<Architect> you want more work do you?
<Architect> haha
<Builder> yes, let's move on

B1-A2-cup-1520467331325
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hey again
<Architect> hey
<Architect> this is interesting...
<Architect> pick up 8 orange blocks
<Builder> what is this supposed to be?
<Architect> put them in a 3X3 layout with no center block
<Architect> well you'll see ;)
<Builder> if you say so...
<Architect> now add a layer of yellow, yellow and orange on top of this structure
<Builder> in the same shape?
<Architect> so one layer of yellow, then another layer of yellow and so on
<Architect> yep
<Architect> then red...
<Architect> nice
<Architect> so this is going to be a cup and we need to add a handle
<Architect> make sense?
<Builder> the cup is hollow!?
<Builder> there's no base
<Architect> yep
<Builder> uhh... seems bad
<Builder> ok
<Architect> let me check...
<Builder> oh crap i'm stuck
<Architect> lol
<Architect> just fly out
<Architect> and yes there's an orange block at the base
<Architect> shit
<Architect> my bad
<Builder> lol...
<Architect> can you add one?
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now the handle is going to be purple
<Architect> 5 blocks
<Architect> can you stop running around so much?
<Architect> lol
<Builder> wow ok...
<Builder> give me something to do then
<Architect> so let's see if you can get the handle right...
<Architect> try placing a purple somewhere you think makes sense for the handle
<Architect> bingo
<Architect> go on...
<Architect> awesome man!!
<Builder> LOL
<Architect> gg
<Builder> interesting...

B1-A2-double_stairs-1520821134339
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Builder> hi
<Architect> so we will build some stairs
<Builder> sounds like a plan
<Architect> put down 6 green blocks in a 2X3 rectangle
<Architect> maybe towards an edge actually
<Architect> with the side with 3 blocks along the edge
<Builder> should the long side be along an edge?
<Builder> oh ok
<Architect> yep
<Architect> now do the same with purple blocks but this time on top of the green blocks
<Architect> also...
<Builder> directly on top?
<Builder> or shifted somehow?
<Architect> exactly
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> haha
<Architect> nice!
<Architect> you guessed it right!
<Builder> :P
<Architect> now another set of green blocks on top of the purple
<Architect> now extend the topmost layer a further two spaces using yellow blocks
<Architect> we will build the second flight going downwards...
<Architect> however..
<Architect> this time there is no overlap between the steps
<Architect> make sense?
<Builder> uhh
<Builder> sort of?
<Builder> give me a color and i'll try
<Architect> orange
<Builder> like starting here?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> then yellow
<Architect> the last one
<Architect> perfect!
<Builder> cool

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi
<Architect> put down 2 red blocks along an edge
<Builder> at the corner or anywhere on the edge?
<Architect> somewhere in the middle
<Builder> how's that?
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> now do the same 7 spaces apart
<Builder> here?
<Architect> my bad
<Architect> that was 8
<Builder> so i should move them closer by 1?
<Architect> no away by 1
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> build a purple rectangle from the top of one of the red rows to the other
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> from where you are standing, put down an orange block to the southeast of the red block on the left
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> phew
<Architect> that was hard
<Architect> lol
<Builder> haha took you a while
<Architect> put down 3 more orangle blocks on top of the last one
<Architect> then 3 more connected to the top and going over the purple layer
<Architect> connect that with the ground with orange blocks
<Architect> cool
<Architect> place 2 yellow blocks on one end of the orange top
<Builder> like going upwards?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> and build a structure similar to the orange one
<Builder> an arch?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> awesome
<Architect> build both these archs on the other end too
<Architect> so that the whole thing is symmetric
<Architect> no
<Architect> no
<Builder> oops
<Architect> :)
<Builder> sorry my cat is on my lap
<Architect> good
<Builder> just fyi i'm all out of orange blocks
<Architect> i see
<Architect> that should be finw
<Architect> fine*
<Architect> only red now
<Architect> so we seem to building a bridge...
<Architect> kind of
<Architect> place a red block next to the one of the yellow corners
<Architect> now 2 more diagonally downward
<Builder> diagonally
<Builder> towards the middle of the bride?
<Builder> bridge
<Architect> yep
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> omg no
<Architect> lol
<Builder> my cat is messing me up
<Architect> ya but you got it right
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now do the same for the remaining 3 yellow corners
<Architect> bingo!
<Architect> gg
<Builder> awesome

B1-A2-wind-farm-1520822691934
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi
<Builder> so, tell me what we're building today
<Architect> looks like a wind farm...
<Builder> like with windmills and stuff?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> haha
<Architect> build an orange tower 6 blocks tall 2 spaces from an edge
<Builder> how's that
<Architect> yep
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> actually
<Architect> hold on
<Builder> ?
<Architect> better if you move it near a corner actually
<Builder> how close to the other edge?
<Architect> the northwest corner...
<Builder> which way is that?
<Builder> my current left?
<Architect> ya relative to where you are facing right now
<Architect> 2 spaces from each edge should be fine...
<Builder> like here?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> sorry about the confusion
<Builder> no problem
<Architect> now one yellow on top
<Architect> and one more touching the current yellow but towards you
<Architect> yep
<Architect> now we need to build the blades...
<Architect> so there are four of them
<Architect> each blade is a couple more yellows in a diagonal direction
<Builder> this jutting out yellow is the middle right?
<Architect> make sense>?
<Builder> wat the heck
<Architect> yep
<Builder> i have no idea how i put down 3 blocks at once
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> nice!
<Architect> now to complete the wind farm we just need to build two more of these...
<Architect> "just"
<Builder> omg...
<Architect> hahaha
<Builder> what colors?
<Architect> the next one is 5 spaces apart from this one
<Architect> to your right
<Architect> red for the tower and blue for the blades
<Builder> here??
<Architect> no one more space apart
<Builder> that doesn't seem like enough space
<Architect> it's 5 spaces apart...
<Builder> ohh barely
<Architect> cool
<Architect> the third one's base is 3 spaces apart from the line joining the two previous bases
<Architect> and in the middle of that line
<Builder> 3 spaces apart?
<Architect> yes so 3 spaces between them,
<Builder> that's the middle of the line
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now place a green block 3 spaces away from it and towards you
<Architect> that's what i meant
<Architect> lol
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes!!
<Architect> go wild!
<Architect> :)
<Builder> what's the blade color?
<Architect> purple
<Builder> oop
<Builder> s
<Architect> niiiiiiiiiiiccceeeeee!
<Builder> yea let's do like 2 fewer of those
<Builder> haha
<Architect> :D

B2-A1-black-hole-1520468852330
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi!
<Architect> so this one's a little confusing
<Architect> it is levitating off the ground
<Builder> :(
<Builder> oh interesting
<Architect> so the first layer won't really matter
<Architect> take any block color besides red and make a 4x4 square
<Architect> laying flat on the ground
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> as long as it's not directly along an edge
<Builder> cool
<Architect> oops
<Architect> it's hollow
<Architect> only need th eoutline
<Architect> ok, now take some red blocks and make another layer on top of that except for the four corners
<Architect> once you've done that, you can remove all the purple blocks
<Builder> ah levitation!
<Architect> good so far
<Architect> ok, now we're going to build a purple layer on top of this, but all the blocks will form an outline around it
<Architect> kind of confusing so i'll break it down
<Builder> i think i know what you mean...
<Architect> first just use whatever blocks besides purple to make another layer directly on top of the red
<Architect> or if you want to build it your own way, it's basically going to be a purple outline around the red, but on the layer on top of it
<Builder> ya i think might be easier to just put one block on the red thing and then take it from there
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> sure
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> but you'll have trouble with the corners
<Architect> i suppose you can do it that way
<Builder> you said an outline right?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> oh i see
<Builder> so the outline hugs the corners too?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> it's like a diamond outline
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> two blocks for the sides and 1 for corners
<Architect> almost
<Architect> so you see how you have a tetris piece right now
<Builder> ya
<Architect> remove those two jutting corners
<Architect> yup
<Builder> i see
<Architect> follow that pattern for the rest of the outline
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> beautiful
<Builder> :)
<Architect> we're done
<Builder> nice!

B2-A1-creative-five-1520468239108
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hola
<Architect> hello
<Architect> start by putting a green block and a blue block next to each other
<Builder> anywhere on the grid?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now grab 3 purple blocks
<Architect> and place them on the right side of the blue block
<Architect> if the green is facing north
<Architect> in a stack
<Architect> on the right side
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> of the blue
<Builder> ah sorry
<Architect> yup
<Architect> now directly over the blue block but attached to the top purple block, place a yellow
<Architect> yes
<Architect> directly over the green but attached to the yellow, place an orange
<Architect> make that orange part of a 3-stack like the purple is
<Builder> what color for the new block?
<Architect> a 3-stack of orange
<Builder> i see
<Builder> i thought i had to connect the green and the orange
<Architect> no, leave the gap
<Architect> it's a 3 stack with that existing orange block as the bottom
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> cool
<Architect> now attached to the top orange and directly over the yellow, place another blue
<Builder> lol
<Builder> okay
<Architect> ok
<Builder> looks like a 5
<Architect> lastly, place a red block attached to the blue, directly over the purple
<Architect> yeah, it's a wonky 5
<Builder> hmm
<Architect> cool
<Builder> aha
<Builder> that's it?
<Architect> yup
<Builder> gg

B2-A1-cross-stack-1520617597855

<Architect> hey
<Builder> hello
<Architect> can you make a row of 3 blocks?
<Builder> sure
<Architect> 2 purple 1 red
<Architect> the red is in the middle
<Builder> where?
<Architect> anywhere
<Architect> cool
<Architect> now make another row on top of it but perpendicular to it
<Architect> this will be two blues and an orange, same pattern
<Builder> on top of which block though?
<Architect> oh
<Architect> the middle one, it makes a cross
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> no
<Architect> that should be orange
<Architect> blue orange blue makes a cross on top of that first row
<Architect> hi? are you ok
<Builder> i don't see how it will be a cross
<Architect> so put the orange block on top of the red block
<Architect> now to the two sides of that orange block, place the two blues
<Architect> perpendicular to the first row
<Architect> from the top it will look like a cross
<Architect> or an x
<Builder> i see!!
<Architect> yes yes
<Architect> ok now two greens and a yellow
<Architect> same thing
<Builder> same as in?
<Architect> perpendicular cross
<Builder> got it
<Architect> beautiful

B2-A1-diagonal-zigzag-1520877184669
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Builder> hey
<Architect> let's start with some blue blocks
<Architect> make an upside down L out of 3 blocks
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yup
<Architect> make that thicker by one block
<Builder> thicker? which segment?
<Architect> you'll put a block in the space closer to you
<Builder> or the whole thing?
<Architect> the whole thing
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now, make a 2x2 square of red blocks that overhangs the blue L
<Architect> so two of the red blocks are directly on top of the portion of the L that is jutting out
<Architect> then the other two red blocks extend past that
<Builder> which end of the blue top though?
<Architect> the part that is jutting out
<Builder> ah
<Builder> sorry
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now we'll make another L shape out of purple blocks, but this time they'll be right-side up
<Architect> and the right side of the bottom of that L will be directly on top of the red blocks
<Architect> you can think of it as you're making another 2x2 square with the purple blocks as you did with the red
<Architect> but then transforming it into an L
<Builder> sure
<Architect> yup
<Architect> that's all
<Builder> cool

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hey
<Architect> let's start by making a 3x3 square standing up
<Architect> but the middle block will be missing
<Architect> (using blue blocks)
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> cool
<Architect> so from where you're standing, directly behind the top and bottom right corners, put purple blocks
<Architect> other side
<Architect> behind the corners
<Builder> ah
<Builder> i thought behind meant towards me
<Architect> do the same for the other two corners but with orange blocks
<Architect> finally, make a red square like the blue one connecting those four blocks
<Architect> the final shape looks like a cube
<Architect> nice :)
<Builder> aaaah
<Builder> :)

B2-A1-overlapping-chain-links-1520877498939
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hi
<Builder> so what are we building this time?
<Architect> let's start by making a standing up hollow 3x3 square with red blocks
<Architect> cool
<Architect> on the middle of the left and right sides of this square, place another two red blocks
<Builder> two each?
<Architect> no no
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> theyre on the same plane as the square
<Architect> and only one each
<Builder> ah
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> good
<Architect> now we're going to build another of this same shape but rotated by 90 degrees
<Architect> using purple blocks
<Builder> where though?
<Architect> to start, put a purple block right behind the right block of the red structure
<Architect> no, the rightmost block
<Builder> ah
<Architect> the part that is sticking out
<Builder> okay
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> cool, now build the square on top of that
<Builder> on top of that?
<Architect> we're making the same structure with purple right
<Architect> you can think of this block you just placed as one of the sides jutting out
<Architect> so build the 3x3 square on top of it
<Architect> such that this purple block juts out of the bottom
<Builder> ooooh
<Architect> wait
<Architect> stop
<Builder> :(
<Architect> make it on the same plane as the red
<Architect> i mean
<Architect> same orientation
<Architect> the blocks will all lie on the plane behind the red
<Builder> so confusing... :(
<Architect> ok so... put one purple block on top of that purple block
<Architect> now put one block behind that corner red block
<Builder> here?
<Architect> nooo
<Architect> other side
<Architect> next to
<Architect> the purple block
<Architect> it's all attached to each other
<Architect> go to the other side
<Builder> ya that's why i'm consfused. lol.
<Architect> attached to the top purple block
<Architect> on the right
<Builder> i think i got it now
<Builder> haha
<Architect> yesss
<Architect> thank god
<Builder> haha
<Builder> how is that rotated by 90?
<Builder> oh like
<Builder> okay okay got it
<Architect> lol
<Architect> bye

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello
<Architect> so we're going to first make a cross standing up with blue blocks
<Architect> but with the middle block missing
<Builder> ok
<Architect> if you think of a 3x3 square, the blue blocks will occupy the middle blocks of each side
<Architect> does it make sense?
<Builder> yes
<Builder> anywhere on the grid?
<Architect> yeah just leave enough room for a block on each side of it
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so in the middle is fine
<Architect> nice
<Architect> so from the way you're facing
<Architect> behind it we'll make a green one of those
<Architect> where the middle gap of the green one is right behind the left block of the blue cross
<Architect> middle space? i guess
<Builder> i see
<Builder> how far behind it though?
<Architect> right behind it
<Builder> ok
<Architect> cool
<Architect> lastly we'll make a purple one
<Architect> so if you're facing the green side
<Architect> the right part of the purple one is right in front of the left side of the green one
<Architect> yes!!
<Builder> :)
<Architect> you are amazing
<Builder> :) :)
<Builder> gg

<Architect> hi
<Architect> time for some easy ones
<Builder> :)
<Architect> we're just going to make a blue question mark
<Architect> first make a stack of 3 blue blocks
<Architect> remove the middle one
<Architect> now make a sideways arch with that top block
<Architect> wait
<Builder> ?
<Architect> shift the right side down by a block
<Architect> and get rid of the top leftmost block
<Architect> topmost leftmost
<Architect> there's no stem to the question mar
<Architect> k
<Builder> no stem
<Builder> lol
<Builder> this ok?
<Architect> too long
<Builder> ok
<Architect> you can start going up from that second one
<Architect> yes, just finish it from there
<Architect> great

B2-A1-rectangle-chain-1520877972918
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi
<Builder> hope this is easier
<Builder> haha
<Architect> uhh....
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> so
<Architect> first build a hollow 4x3 blue rectangle
<Builder> all blocks on the ground?
<Architect> standing up
<Builder> which side on the ground then?
<Architect> that's right
<Architect> sof ar
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> i think so
<Architect> ok so
<Architect> let's build another 4x3 rectangle but purple this time
<Architect> the left side of the purple is adjacent to the right of the blue side
<Architect> and the purple rectangle is perpendicular to the blue
<Architect> so start with 3 purple blocks directly adjacent to the right of the side of the blue rectangle
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> uhh
<Architect> actually
<Architect> let's put it on the other side
<Builder> lol
<Architect> if you're going to build it that direction
<Builder> ok
<Architect> sure that works
<Architect> so you're going to build another 4x3 rectangle of green blocks
<Architect> but this one will link the blue and purple ones together
<Builder> thought so :P
<Architect> the blue and purple rectangles pass through the hollow gap of the green
<Builder> i see
<Builder> i think i might know how to do this
<Architect> that one you placed was right i think
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes!
<Builder> yay
<Architect> now lastly a red 4x3
<Architect> it hooks on to the end of the purple rectangle
<Architect> wait
<Architect> shift it inwards by 1
<Architect> it will jut out further than the green rectangle
<Builder> i see
<Architect> very nice
<Builder> phew
<Builder> almost ran out of space there
<Builder> haha
<Architect> yeah i wasn't sure
<Architect> but it worked out haha
