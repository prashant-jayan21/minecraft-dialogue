<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi
<Architect> you're building a bunch of diagonal staircases
<Architect> start with yellow
<Architect> and towards the edge but in the center
<Architect> more towards the middle of that edge
<Builder> here?
<Architect> i mean where you should put your starting block
<Architect> the yellow staircase is in the middle
<Builder> in the middle of the building area?
<Builder> oh wait
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yeah great; the second one
<Architect> now a staircase: one towards teh center, but also raised vertically
<Architect> good
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> one more like that so there's three steps
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> good
<Architect> switch to orange
<Architect> face along the length of hte yellow staircase
<Architect> the starting orange block is three to teh left
<Architect> five back
<Builder> to my left?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> build one orange on top of it
<Architect> delete the bottom one
<Architect> now make a diagonal staircase
<Builder> towards the orange?
<Builder> i mean yellow?
<Architect> imagine a 2x2 cube where the two orange blocks make up opposite corners
<Architect> great
<Architect> now do the same to make it three long
<Architect> good switch to red
<Architect> orient yourself on the far side of the yellow staircase
<Architect> loooking in towards the center
<Builder> here?
<Architect> look along the length of the yellow
<Architect> like stand behind it
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> red starting block is 4 to the left and 3 up
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> fixed it
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now just do teh same thing you did with the orange blocks
<Architect> sloping towards the center
<Builder> okay
<Architect> starting on the bottom level though
<Builder> i see
<Architect> don't delete your starting block
<Architect> good one more
<Architect> great

<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi; this one is shitty
<Architect> start with yellow
<Architect> place one in the center of one of the lines near the edge
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> now still on the flat surface place one above each of the diagonal corners
<Builder> like a c?
<Architect> good; repeat to make a V
<Architect> still diagonal from the previous squares
<Builder> extended?
<Builder> oh ok
<Architect> good
<Architect> switch to orange
<Architect> now you're building a 3d staircase from the top of one of the sides of the V
<Architect> start on the flat surface
<Architect> one above the outer yellow block
<Architect> either side
<Architect> no delete ththose
<Architect> stand at one of teh outer blocks
<Architect> put one in front of it
<Architect> great
<Architect> now build a 3d staircase
<Architect> diagonal slope
<Builder> here?
<Architect> jutting away from the V
<Builder> the first step is yellow right?
<Architect> not really; the first step is orange, but it is in line with the yellow blocks
<Architect> okay build one more orange in front of that orange
<Architect> now one orange on top of teh second orange
<Architect> now delete the second orange
<Architect> good repeat to make a third step
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> now build that same structure on the other side of the V
<Architect> well done
<Architect> switch to red
<Builder> ok
<Architect> you're making a diamond
<Architect> put a red block in front of the final orange blocks
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> same on other side
<Architect> now one below the red block
<Architect> and to the right
<Builder> is it a bridge?
<Architect> you're essentially making that V shape in red, but it's vertical
<Architect> delete those
<Builder> here?
<Architect> no all the red blocks are in the same plane
<Architect> yep one above that now
<Architect> one down and to the right
<Architect> now one up and to the right
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> good delete all but the middle base ones
<Architect> great
<Architect> make that same shape above to make a diamond
<Builder> above the red?

<Builder> a tower?
<Architect> no like you're making a cube
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> they need to be flush with the blues
<Builder> what do you mean?
<Architect> the goal is to make a 3x3 square on the base
<Builder> oh let me try
<Architect> the reds are teh second column in the square
<Architect> good
<Builder> okay

<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi; this one is pretty complicated
<Architect> start with blue
<Architect> towards the edge
<Architect> place three on top of each other
<Builder> anywhere is fine?
<Architect> yeah that's good; delete the bottom one
<Builder> done
<Architect> build one next to the top one
<Architect> towards the center
<Architect> one on top of that
<Architect> one more next to the newest one
<Builder> here?
<Architect> next to it not on top
<Architect> good
<Architect> you'll make that same structure two more times
<Architect> second one is almost directly above the first
<Builder> okay. what color?
<Architect> blue still; start in the middle column, build up three blocks
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> good; delete the middle one
<Architect> the other middle one
<Architect> good; just make the same structure as below it
<Builder> okay
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> now the third one is farther away
<Builder> still blue?
<Architect> look at the tip of the second "m"
<Architect> still blue
<Architect> two blank spaces towards the center then one space to the right
<Builder> here?
<Architect> one more towards the center
<Architect> good
<Architect> build a tower straight up
<Builder> how big?
<Architect> there
<Builder> 7?
<Architect> it's hard to tell; the thing is just floating
<Builder> are the tops aligned?
<Architect> the third one's top is one taller than the second one
<Builder> by how much?
<Architect> make the top of your tower the starting block then make the same structure
<Architect> oops you added more
<Architect> the top of your tower lines up with the middle row of the second "m"
<Builder> wait so the 7th block was the start right?
<Architect> yep
<Builder> so that should be okay?
<Architect> it needs to move down one space
<Builder> is this okay?
<Architect> yes great
<Builder> good
<Architect> now switch to orange
<Architect> look at the shadows of two structures
<Architect> the one with four spaces
<Architect> move two spaces to the left
<Architect> on the opposite side of the third structure
<Architect> in line with the four shadows
<Builder> where should i stand?
<Architect> there is good
<Architect> leave two blank spaces, then place an orange block
<Architect> such that it lines up with the top of the shadows
<Architect> great
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now build a tower straight up
<Architect> line up with the top of the second structure
<Builder> it might be easier to connect the stuctures from before?
<Architect> there's no connection though
<Architect> build one more up
<Architect> delete all but the top three
<Architect> rotate 90 degrees and face the orange line
<Architect> okay; put three more orange blocks to the right of that
<Architect> you're making a flat 3x3 square
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes; fill in any gaps below it

<Builder> sorry talking to aid
<Architect> okay here we go
<Builder> lets do this
<Architect> walk forward 3 steps
<Architect> place a yellow block
<Architect> place another yellow block next to it but away from the purple block
<Builder> north or east?
<Architect> either is ok
<Architect> place 3 more yellow blocks along that line
<Architect> away from the purple block
<Builder> good?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> place a green block on each of the yellow blocks
<Architect> place a red block on the side opposite the purple block
<Architect> by the furthest yellow block
<Architect> not there
<Architect> on the other opposite side
<Architect> exactly
<Architect> now place a purple block on top of that one
<Architect> place another red block along the diagonal toward the purple block
<Builder> red for reference
<Architect> understood
<Architect> not there
<Builder> where?
<Architect> along the diagonal from the blocks we were working on
<Architect> the red and purple blocks
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now place a purple block on top of that one
<Builder> I wil stay right over the blocks if needed. left right work for me too
<Architect> got it
<Architect> continuing along this same diagonal
<Architect> place a blue block
<Architect> now move along the diagonal away from red and toward the purple block
<Architect> placing two more blue blocks

<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> the first layer is orange
<Architect> correction
<Architect> this first layer has an orange block in the middle
<Architect> but the rest are empty
<Architect> the next layer is yellow
<Builder> understood
<Architect> now another yellow layer
<Architect> next an orange layer
<Architect> then a red layer
<Architect> now suppose what we're building is a coffee muf
<Architect> mug
<Builder> what color handle
<Architect> next we're going to add a purple handle
<Architect> it goes from the top orange layer
<Architect> to the bottom yellow layer
<Architect> two blocks out
<Architect> excellent

<Architect> place a red block in front of the blue block
<Architect> along the line toward the purple block
<Architect> place another red block along that line
<Architect> place a red block on top of the block you just palce
<Architect> placed
<Builder> don't worry about minor typos i get what youre going for
<Architect> place 4 stacks of red blocks 2 high
<Architect> along the same line
<Architect> 5 stacks
<Architect> place 1 more red block on the 2nd and third stacks
<Architect> remove the bottom block from the first 3 high stack
<Architect> remove the two bottom blocks from the second 3 high stack
<Architect> remove the bottom block from the last 3 stacks
<Architect> build an orange staircase next
<Architect> starting one block up and over from the yellow block
<Architect> yes
<Architect> toward the red blocks
<Builder> how many blocks wide
<Architect> i messed up
<Builder> thats alright what do i need to fix
<Architect> the staircase needs to be shifted over one block away from the yellow block
<Builder> this doesn't count towards our GPA :)
<Architect> no no
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> shift along the line it is on
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now fill in the line with orange blocks
<Architect> at the same height
<Builder> which line
<Architect> the orange block line
<Architect> we need them all the way to four blocks past the red
<Architect> remove the bottom orange block at the last stair on the yellow block side
<Architect> not that one
<Architect> exactly
<Architect> now make a red stack 4 high
<Architect> at the end of the red line
<Architect> add one more to the top
<Architect> remove the bottom two
<Architect> ok
<Architect> now for some bad news
<Builder> hit me
<Architect> the whole orange block structure needs to be shifted up one block toward the purple block
<Architect> excellent
<Architect> now
<Architect> place one more red block two red blocks away from the orange blocks on the blue block side
<Builder> which orange block
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> on the red block line
<Architect> but one block closer to the orange blocks
<Architect> it needs to go no top of the red blocks that are already there
<Architect> one more closer to the orange blocks
<Architect> exactly
<Architect> now remove the red block beneath the one you just placed
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now, place 3 red blocks
<Architect> on top of the orange block that is on the red block line
<Architect> great, now remove the bottom two you just placed
<Architect> on top of the red block that is one block closer to the purple block
<Architect> place 4 more red blocks
<Architect> remove the bottom 3
<Architect> now we're going to work exclusively with the orange blocks
<Architect> on the opposite side of the yellow block
<Architect> place a 5 stack of orange blocks
<Architect> at the end of that line of orange blocks
<Builder> i only have four orange blocks left
<Architect> i see
<Architect> remove the stack adjacent to the red blocks
<Architect> place them all on the next stack
<Architect> so it will be 6 high
<Architect> then remove the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th blocks
<Architect> now completely remove the next stack
<Architect> now remove the 1st, 2nd, and 4th from the last stack
<Architect> now remove reference blocks
<Architect> remove the orange block

<Architect> leave room for a 7x7 structure
<Architect> we'll start with the easiest
<Architect> purple
<Architect> this one floats in the air one block above the ground
<Architect> actually move it one block inwards
<Architect> okay so from where you are currently looking
<Architect> put two purple to the right
<Architect> now fill upwards to make a 3x3 square
<Architect> punch out blocks from that to make an "X"
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> good description
<Architect> thank you
<Architect> now switch to yello
<Architect> it also floats
<Architect> the top of yellow lines up with the top of purple
<Builder> how close to the purple structure?
<Architect> it starts one block under purple (to your left)
<Builder> ?
<Architect> no sorry
<Architect> it's in the same line as the purple
<Architect> the long side of purple
<Architect> scoot it over one block so there's a space between
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now build two up
<Architect> knock down the bottom two
<Architect> make a line
<Architect> same as you did for purple
<Architect> like same direction
<Architect> knock out the middle
<Architect> we're going to move to building on the opposite side you're on
<Architect> so other side of the purple and yellow
<Architect> still attached to the yellow
<Architect> so right at the edge
<Architect> in line with the two yellow you already made
<Architect> floating one block above the ground
<Architect> other edge sorry
<Architect> you'll place two blocks similar to the ones floating in the air
<Builder> which yellow block?
<Builder> i'll place one and you can tell me how to shift it
<Architect> alrighty
<Architect> if you moved that two forward
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> it's yellow though
<Architect> but yes!
<Architect> the other yellow you'll place will be lined up with the other high yellow
<Architect> same level as the one you just did
<Architect> nice
<Builder> these shapes are f-ed up
<Architect> so place the last yellow so it connects the 4 you made
<Architect> yeah, this one is really tricky
<Architect> now for green
<Architect> so you know the space between purple and yellow?
<Builder> yah
<Architect> two blocks over, place a green on the ground
<Builder> two blocks over from what?
<Architect> from that space
<Architect> so it'll be one block away from purple
<Architect> yup
<Architect> now in the direction of purple, make a 3x3 cube
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yup
<Architect> once you're done i'll try to tell you which block to punch out
<Builder> ran out of greens
<Architect> oh okay
<Architect> pick a direction to face
<Architect> we'll start at top
<Architect> bottom right and top left have blocks
<Builder> ?
<Architect> oh shoot sorry, i meant starting at the top level
<Builder> looking down?
<Architect> the only blocks are bottom right and top left
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> perf
<Architect> next level
<Architect> only the middle
<Builder> lol the only one i don't have placed
<Architect> and the bottom level is same as top
<Architect> that was hard

<Architect> start with green
<Architect> three across
<Architect> add one more sorry
<Architect> so from the first green you placed add two 90 degrees to what you just made
<Architect> other side sorry
<Architect> add one yellow block to the other end of what you first made
<Architect> same side as the two green you just added
<Builder> 90 degrees to the first line?
<Architect> yeah so how you did those two green
<Architect> delete that
<Architect> see the 90 degree joint made by the green?
<Builder> yep
<Architect> count 3 below that and place the yellow
<Builder> three blank spaces or two blank spaces?
<Architect> 3 blank
<Builder> here?
<Architect> it's attached to the green
<Architect> uhm, attached to the 4th green block
<Architect> other side
<Architect> and just one yello
<Architect> nice, now red
<Architect> red blocks look like green but rotated 180 degrees
<Architect> the entire shape looks like an S
<Builder> i don't know where to put the red blocks
<Architect> one red next to the yellow
<Builder> just hte L shape again?
<Architect> yes the L shape
<Architect> that's it

<Architect> put one green on one side of yellow
<Architect> one on opposite side of yellow
<Architect> okay, now a blue block will be attached to orange
<Architect> NOT under green
<Architect> one on the other side
<Architect> purple attached to red
<Architect> NOT under blue
<Architect> we got it

<Architect> we're going to make another "T"
<Architect> so go...
<Architect> 4 up from the middle of the one you made
<Architect> and then one to the left
<Architect> yup
<Architect> it's turned 90 degrees to the other one
<Builder> green again?
<Architect> yup
<Architect> stay facing that direction
<Architect> we're switching to blue
<Architect> you see the edges of the top part of the T?
<Builder> yep
<Architect> so if you look from that angle, on either side will be blue
<Architect> it will be one block behind though
<Architect> sorry two behind
<Architect> no sorry
<Architect> uhm let's start over
<Builder> lol
<Architect> walk behind the T
<Architect> okay on the side you're on, mark two blocks behind T
<Architect> now place one blue to the left
<Architect> build a pillar to the ground
<Architect> delete the two blocks connecting that to "T"
<Architect> so the same 4 blocks below that
<Architect> essentially I need you to make 4 pillars
<Architect> delete the wall
<Architect> but keep the initial pillar
<Architect> go 4 blocks down
<Architect> yup
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> great!
<Builder> good lol
<Architect> now place 1 orange on all the towers
<Architect> alrighty
<Architect> it's going to make a roof shape
<Architect> but some blocks are punched out
<Architect> it's basically blocks on a diagonal
<Architect> yup
<Architect> punch out the middle blocks
<Architect> no sorry leave that one
<Architect> on the level blow that
<Architect> so it'll come to a point on top
<Architect> yes!
<Builder> :)
<Architect> punch out a cross under that block
<Architect> we're good!
<Builder> nice

B4-A20-multiple_concepts-1522767672579
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> whole thing will be 5 blocks long
<Architect> 5x9
<Architect> keep that in mind for space
<Architect> the blocks spell out "L = 5"
<Architect> start with green
<Builder> how's that?
<Architect> add one more green to the longer side of L
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now switch to purple
<Architect> leave one block space
<Architect> one more purple to each line to finish the = sign
<Architect> now blue for the S
<Architect> it's same height as L
<Architect> two block wide
<Architect> all good
