<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hi
<Builder> so, tell me what we're building today
<Architect> looks like a wind farm...
<Builder> like with windmills and stuff?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> haha
<Architect> build an orange tower 6 blocks tall 2 spaces from an edge
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]

<Architect> yep
<Architect> looks good
<Architect> actually
<Architect> hold on
<Builder> ?
<Architect> better if you move it near a corner actually
<Builder> how close to the other edge?
<Architect> the northwest corner...
<Builder> which way is that?
<Builder> my current left?
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:6 Z:-1]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]

<Architect> now one yellow on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:3 Y:7 Z:2]
<Architect> now we need to build the blades...

<Architect> now to complete the wind farm we just need to build two more of these...
<Architect> "just"
<Builder> omg...
<Architect> hahaha
<Builder> what colors?
<Architect> the next one is 5 spaces apart from this one
<Architect> to your right
<Architect> red for the tower and blue for the blades
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> here??

<Architect> and in the middle of that line
<Builder> 3 spaces apart?
<Architect> yes so 3 spaces between them,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> that's the middle of the line
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now place a green block 3 spaces away from it and towards you
<Architect> that's what i meant

<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi!
<Architect> so this one's a little confusing
<Architect> it is levitating off the ground
<Builder> :(
<Builder> oh interesting
<Architect> so the first layer won't really matter
<Architect> take any block color besides red and make a 4x4 square
<Architect> laying flat on the ground

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> ah levitation!
<Architect> good so far
<Architect> ok, now we're going to build a purple layer on top of this, but all the blocks will form an outline around it
<Architect> kind of confusing so i'll break it down
<Builder> i think i know what you mean...
<Architect> first just use whatever blocks besides purple to make another layer directly on top of the red
<Architect> or if you want to build it your own way, it's basically going to be a purple outline around the red, but on the layer on top of it
<Builder> ya i think might be easier to just put one block on the red thing and then take it from there
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> sure
<Architect> yeah
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> but you'll have trouble with the corners
<Architect> i suppose you can do it that way
<Builder> you said an outline right?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> oh i see
<Builder> so the outline hugs the corners too?
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> it's like a diamond outline
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> two blocks for the sides and 1 for corners
<Architect> almost
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> so you see how you have a tetris piece right now
<Builder> ya
<Architect> remove those two jutting corners
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> yup
<Builder> i see
<Architect> follow that pattern for the rest of the outline
<Builder> gotcha

[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:3 Z:3]
<Builder> what color for the new block?
<Architect> a 3-stack of orange
<Builder> i see
<Builder> i thought i had to connect the green and the orange
<Architect> no, leave the gap
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:4 Y:2 Z:7]

<Builder> lol
<Builder> okay
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:7 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3]
<Builder> looks like a 5
<Architect> lastly, place a red block attached to the blue, directly over the purple

<Architect> the middle one, it makes a cross
<Builder> gotcha
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> no
<Architect> that should be orange
<Architect> blue orange blue makes a cross on top of that first row
<Architect> hi? are you ok
<Builder> i don't see how it will be a cross
<Architect> so put the orange block on top of the red block
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> now to the two sides of that orange block, place the two blues
<Architect> perpendicular to the first row
<Architect> from the top it will look like a cross
<Architect> or an x
<Builder> i see!!
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]

<Architect> hello
<Builder> hey
<Architect> let's start with some blue blocks
<Architect> make an upside down L out of 3 blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yup
<Architect> make that thicker by one block
<Builder> thicker? which segment?
<Architect> you'll put a block in the space closer to you
<Builder> or the whole thing?
<Architect> the whole thing
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now, make a 2x2 square of red blocks that overhangs the blue L
<Architect> so two of the red blocks are directly on top of the portion of the L that is jutting out
<Architect> then the other two red blocks extend past that
<Builder> which end of the blue top though?
<Architect> the part that is jutting out
<Builder> ah
<Builder> sorry
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now we'll make another L shape out of purple blocks, but this time they'll be right-side up
<Architect> and the right side of the bottom of that L will be directly on top of the red blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> you can think of it as you're making another 2x2 square with the purple blocks as you did with the red
<Architect> but then transforming it into an L
<Builder> sure
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> yup
<Architect> that's all
<Builder> cool

<Builder> hi
<Architect> hey
<Architect> let's start by making a 3x3 square standing up
<Architect> but the middle block will be missing
<Architect> (using blue blocks)
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> yeah

[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> so from where you're standing, directly behind the top and bottom right corners, put purple blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> behind the corners
<Builder> ah
<Builder> i thought behind meant towards me

<Architect> hi
<Builder> so what are we building this time?
<Architect> let's start by making a standing up hollow 3x3 square with red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]

[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> cool
<Architect> on the middle of the left and right sides of this square, place another two red blocks
<Builder> two each?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> no no
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> theyre on the same plane as the square
<Architect> and only one each
<Builder> ah
<Builder> gotcha
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> now we're going to build another of this same shape but rotated by 90 degrees
<Architect> using purple blocks
<Builder> where though?
<Architect> to start, put a purple block right behind the right block of the red structure
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> ah
<Architect> the part that is sticking out
<Builder> okay
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> cool, now build the square on top of that
<Builder> on top of that?
<Architect> we're making the same structure with purple right
<Architect> you can think of this block you just placed as one of the sides jutting out
<Architect> so build the 3x3 square on top of it
<Architect> such that this purple block juts out of the bottom
<Builder> ooooh
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> stop
<Builder> :(
<Architect> make it on the same plane as the red
<Architect> i mean
<Architect> same orientation
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> so confusing... :(
<Architect> ok so... put one purple block on top of that purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> nooo
<Architect> other side
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> the purple block
<Architect> it's all attached to each other
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> ya that's why i'm consfused. lol.
<Architect> attached to the top purple block
<Architect> on the right
<Builder> i think i got it now
<Builder> haha
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]

<Architect> hello
<Architect> so we're going to first make a cross standing up with blue blocks
<Architect> but with the middle block missing
<Builder> ok
<Architect> if you think of a 3x3 square, the blue blocks will occupy the middle blocks of each side
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:7 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:7 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:7 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:7 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:7 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> does it make sense?
<Builder> yes
<Builder> anywhere on the grid?
<Architect> yeah just leave enough room for a block on each side of it
<Builder> ok
<Architect> so in the middle is fine
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> nice
<Architect> so from the way you're facing
<Architect> behind it we'll make a green one of those
<Architect> where the middle gap of the green one is right behind the left block of the blue cross
<Architect> middle space? i guess
<Builder> i see
<Builder> how far behind it though?
<Architect> right behind it
<Builder> ok
[Builder picks up a green block at X:7 Y:1 Z:2]

<Builder> ?
<Architect> shift the right side down by a block
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:2]
<Architect> topmost leftmost
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:2]
<Architect> k
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:2]

<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi
<Builder> hope this is easier
<Builder> haha
<Architect> uhh....
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> so
<Architect> first build a hollow 4x3 blue rectangle
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> standing up
<Builder> which side on the ground then?
<Architect> that's right
<Architect> sof ar
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> i think so
<Architect> ok so
<Architect> let's build another 4x3 rectangle but purple this time
<Architect> the left side of the purple is adjacent to the right of the blue side
<Architect> and the purple rectangle is perpendicular to the blue
<Architect> so start with 3 purple blocks directly adjacent to the right of the side of the blue rectangle
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> yes
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> actually
<Architect> let's put it on the other side
<Builder> lol
<Architect> if you're going to build it that direction
<Builder> ok
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> so you're going to build another 4x3 rectangle of green blocks
<Architect> but this one will link the blue and purple ones together
<Builder> thought so :P
<Architect> the blue and purple rectangles pass through the hollow gap of the green
<Builder> i see
<Builder> i think i might know how to do this
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> that one you placed was right i think

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes!
<Builder> yay
<Architect> now lastly a red 4x3
<Architect> it hooks on to the end of the purple rectangle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> shift it inwards by 1
<Architect> it will jut out further than the green rectangle
<Builder> i see
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-4 Y:2 Z:3]

<Builder> phew
<Builder> almost ran out of space there
<Builder> haha
<Architect> yeah i wasn't sure
<Architect> but it worked out haha
