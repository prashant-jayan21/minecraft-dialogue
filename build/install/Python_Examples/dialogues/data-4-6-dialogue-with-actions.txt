<Architect> ok remove the thing sticking out on the right of the purple one. my bad
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:5 Y:7 Z:4]
<Architect> and just move it to the left of the highest purple block
<Builder> on the opposite side?
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:5 Y:7 Z:2]
<Builder> here?

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> ok allow me some time to think of instructions
<Builder> it might be easier to describe all one color?
<Builder> then build from there?
<Architect> ok lets finish up the yellows then
<Architect> place one yellow a column to the right of the orange block, 1 space higher, and 1 space further back
<Builder> back meaning away?
<Builder> or towards me?
<Architect> into the page
<Architect> lol
<Architect> away yes

[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a green block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> yep
<Builder> here?
<Architect> if you could return to the front of the structure every time, it wouldh elp with the instructions I think
<Architect> the other green block is 3 spaces to the left and 1 space up of the last yellow block you placed

<Builder> hello
<Architect> hello
<Architect> begin by placing 2 yellow blocks flat on the ground. place them near the center
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> is this ok?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now place 2 more blocks vertically on top of the yellow block on the right
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> inverse L?
<Architect> yeah it's an inverse L. perfect. Now 2 more blocks to the right of the 2 blocks you just placed
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yeah that's fine. place 1 block in the corner
<Architect> the corner that isn't the L
<Architect> this structure is completely 2 dimensional
<Builder> oh in the intersection..
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> place 2 more blocks. 1 above the middle highest yellow, one above the right highest yellow
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?

[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> so you see that yellow block that's the highest? place a block to the right of it
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:0]
<Architect> we're only building up from this point so don't worry about blocks undernearth
<Builder> here?
<Builder> ok
<Architect> now switch to purple.
<Architect> looking at the structure, place 4 purple blocks each above the two highest yellow blocks. 8 purple blocks total
<Builder> two towers?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> of four blocks?

[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:0]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> place 2 more towers at the same elevation of the purple structure. 3 blocks tall this time instead of 2
<Architect> on the side
<Builder> which side?
<Architect> the sides of the purple structure
<Builder> oh so 4x4?
<Architect> yeah so like make a 4 by 4 but without the top left and top right corner blocks

<Builder> is it all 2d?
<Architect> it is not 2 dimensional
<Architect> ok we're gonna build 1 corner of the umbrella and then I need you to mirror it in 4 directions
<Builder> got it
<Architect> so start by placing 2 red blocks towards you on the second highest red block
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:8 Z:-4]
<Builder> like this?

[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok in each corner of the 4 red branches we have 3 orange blocks. it makes a stair like pattern try placing 3 blocks in a corner in a stairlike pattern
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-5]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-6]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-6]

<Builder> three blocks similar to the red?
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-6]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-6]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-7]

[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-6]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-6]
<Builder> this is the edge of the building area...
<Architect> facet he front of the drawing. then look at the red branch sticking out to the east
<Architect> to your right
<Architect> ok excellent. now place a red block where your head is
<Architect> wait jk
<Builder> where is the front?
<Architect> where you are is the front.
<Architect> approach the right red branch
<Architect> like just look at it. fly up to it
<Architect> ok so you see the 4 red blocks sticking out?
<Builder> the arm?
<Architect> put 1 orange block on the top left one. yes the arm
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:3 Y:8 Z:-2]
<Builder> here?

<Architect> this is a 2d build again, at its widest point it's gonna be 7 blocks
<Architect> first, put down 4 purple blocks in a line
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
<Architect> on the 3 rightmost blocks, put down 3 blue blocks
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> then on the rightmost blue block, add a purple block to the right side of it
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> ok, on the left of the blue block, put a floating purple block one block apart from it
<Architect> if that doesn't make sense lmk
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> oh my bad, it should've been on the same row as the blue block
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> put one block apart from it, which would make it floating
<Architect> nah like in line with the blue blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:2 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> yea like that
<Builder> kool
<Architect> put two more purple blocks ontop of the leftmost purple block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]

<Architect> put a purple block on the middle blue block
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> and a blue block next to that one
<Architect> next to the purple block u just put down
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> then one space apart, put another purple block to the right of the block you just put down
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
<Architect> aight this is gonna get tricky, so i think from here on out we should just go row by row
<Architect> so u dont lose your mind lol
<Builder> k
<Architect> on the topmost row, the final product should be purple, purple, blue, space, purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:5 Z:0]

<Architect> kk, this one is a lil crazy
<Builder> aright
<Architect> you need 7 blocks worth of space
<Architect> since thata's how big it is at its widest point
<Architect> but start by putting two red blocks 1 block apart
<Builder> k
<Builder> what corner of the structure are we starting on
<Architect> the middle
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]

<Builder> yeah
<Architect> and it's 4 blocks long, 4 blocks wide, and 6 blocks tall
<Architect> first, put a red block down
<Architect> in a place where the dimensions will fit
<Builder> what corner are we starting at?
<Architect> just put it in the second row in the middle from any edge of the box
<Architect> like 6th column, second row from any side of the square
<Architect> doesn't matter, as long as we can build out 4 blocks and to the left or right 2 blocks
<Builder> yeah
<Architect> if u put it two blocks back that'll work
<Architect> from the one ur looking at
<Architect> yea that works
<Architect> so the red block goes there

[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, great!
<Architect> now place another orange block on top of the center one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> Sorry place another orange block on top of this one
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> another square around this one?
<Architect> Great, now we're going to make a plus sign with green blocks
<Architect> plus sign this time!
<Builder> cool
<Builder> center of the plus on top of the last orange block i placed?
<Architect> The orange block is the center sorry
<Builder> ah got it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:5 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> or is the plus bigger?
<Architect> Yes perfect! now stack two yellow blocks on top of the orange one in the center, but remove the first one so there's just one floating on top
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:7 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Architect> Awesome! Ok there are a few random blocks left to place here and there
<Architect> There is a red block jutting out on the left side next to the orange block standing by itself
<Builder> which orange block?
<Architect> I think it's the third one from down
<Architect> wait fourth one
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Yes except it's right next to that one. So place another one to the left and then remove this one
<Builder> gotcha
<Builder> ya that's why i was a bit confused
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:4 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-1]
<Architect> yeah sorry! Ok now we're going to do the same thing with a purple block
<Builder> np
<Architect> Place one above the orange block on the right side of the plus sign at the bottom
<Architect> You're standing in the right spot
<Builder> ya not sure which place you mean
<Architect> Sorry so the base of the structure is a plus right. Place a purple block on top of the right orange block of the plus sign
<Architect> Stack it, I mean
<Builder> right orange block of the pus sign?
<Builder> plus*
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> you mean here?
<Architect> No you have to go all the way to the bottom
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:-1]
<Builder> oh this plus sign!!
<Builder> i thought the green one!
<Builder> lol
<Builder> forgot there were two plus signs
<Architect> No worries!
<Builder> ya that's why i didn't understand when you said base of the structure
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah sorry i may have forgotton to say orange plus
<Architect> yes. Now place a purple one to the right of this one and then remove this one
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
<Architect> Great! now go the left side of the plus sign.
<Architect> And place a blue block two squares above the one directly next to the orange block
<Architect> sorry that was confusing
<Builder> haha
<Builder> np
<Architect> so on the left side of the plus, instead of placing the blue block directly next to the orange one, place it two squares above,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> I don't know if that helps either lol
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a orange block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> not sure if that's right
<Architect> It has to be down next to the base structure
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:0 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> like on the ground
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yes that's right, but it's on the wrong side sorry. We want it on the side opposite the random purple block
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> so this side...
<Architect> yes
<Builder> now two squares above which block exactly?
<Architect> So maybe it's easier if I tell you to place it somewhere first and then move it. Place it on the ground next to the orange block
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> Yes now move it to the left by two squares
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes, great! now place another blue block on top of it
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Builder> phew :)
<Architect> Now remove the bottom blue one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:2 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> and we're done! phew
<Builder> haha
<Builder> cool

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> Place two yellow blocks on the grid. This structure mostly goes upward so you don't need a lot of room. But don't go too close to the edges
<Builder> sounds good
<Builder> so a stack of yellow blocks?
<Architect> Sorry two next to each other
<Builder> cool
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great. Now stack another yellow one on top of the right one, and place another yellow one to the right of the stacked block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Now you're going to stack three yellow blocks in a row, top on top of these and then one jutting out
<Builder> on top of which block?
<Architect> Oh sorry the two blocks you just stacked
<Builder> ah i see what you mean
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
<Builder> i thought by stack you meant vertically stack
<Builder> is this what you had in mind?
<Architect> Sorry! I meant stack one on top of each
<Architect> Yes this is perfect
<Builder> ah!
<Builder> gotcha
<Architect> Now stack a yellow block each on top of the center block and the right block
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-3 Y:4 Z:1]
<Builder> just curious...what are we building?
<Architect> You stacked on the left and right. Can you move the left block to the center?
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a yellow block at X:-2 Y:4 Z:1]
<Architect> I have no idea!
<Builder> ah my bad
<Builder> lol
<Builder> okay
<Architect> Great! Now we're going to place four purple blocks on a row on top of this. Two are stacked on the two blocks on top here
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> The other two jut out on either side
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:5 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Now stack four purple blocks in a row on top of this row
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:1]
<Architect> Now add a block to either side so it juts out. a row of six purple blocks total
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-5 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:0]
<Architect> Nice! Now place four more purple blocks in a row on top of the four center blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:7 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-4 Y:7 Z:1]
<Architect> Great! Last step. Stack a purple block on each of the middle two blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:1]
<Architect> We're done!
<Builder> gg

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> Place three blue blocks in the center of a row
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> You can start about three rows down from top
<Builder> sure
<Builder> exact center?
<Builder> or roughly?
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> No it doesn't really matter there should just be enough space to build a few blocks on on all sides
<Builder> cool
<Architect> Now place two more blue blocks one below the other in front of the left one
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> Oh sorry I didn't mean on top
<Architect> I meant next to the left one
[Builder picks up a blue block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Builder> here?
<Architect> Yeah that's right!
<Architect> This entire structure is flat so there is no stacking at all
<Builder> cool
<Architect> Now place two more blue blocks on the right of the block you're standing right in front
<Architect> right in front of
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:0 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
<Architect> Great!
<Architect> Now put two green blocks in the center to form a 3X3 square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Cool. Now place another green block next to the green one on the right so that it juts out of the square
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> Perfect. Now place two green blocks behind it
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:4]
<Architect> Great, this is the last step. Place two green blocks right next to the one jutting out
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:4]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:1 Z:4]
<Builder> done?
<Architect> yes done!
<Builder> :)
