<Builder> hello. what are we building this time?
<Architect> hello builder, i will tell you this. it appears we are creating a belltower. but first i will start with step by step instructions. we will start with green blocks
<Architect> please start with 8 green blocks extending straight up. this will need to be placed as far right as you can, preferably centered along the other axis
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> ok
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> yes, one moment
<Architect> on the 8th block to the left of the green block, please create the same structure with red blocks
<Builder> on top the 8th block?
<Architect> sorry, my mistake
<Architect> it should start on the ground
<Architect> i only meant 8 blocks away from the first green block, to the left
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> good job builder. if you can do this without a supporting structure then please do. we need yet another row of purple blocks that is 9 long so that it lays across the green and red, on top of them
<Builder> starting and ending from the red and green?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> excellent builder
<Architect> now we must create the bell. please start by extending 4 orange blocks down from the middle purple block, as if it were hanging
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes. now we need 3 blocks on both sides of the bottom three blocks so that is looks like a 3x3 square hanging off of the purple row
<Builder> okay
<Builder> orange?
<Architect> yes, orange. sorry
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> great. now please place 1 orange block on the bottom corners of the 3x3 square so that it is shaped like a bell
<Architect> yes that is good
<Builder> here?
<Architect> not quite. they should be on the left and right sides, not the bottom side. my mistake
<Builder> oh i see. my mistake
<Architect> good job builder. we have 1 final piece
<Architect> please place 1 yellow block on the bottom of the bell, in the middle
<Architect> builder, we have done it
<Builder> good job!
<Architect> you too builder! you are a master craftsman/woman

<Builder> hello. What are we building this time?
<Architect> hello builder. we will start with red blocks. please build a 4x4 open window so that a 2x2 space is open in the middle
<Builder> flat on the ground?
<Builder> anywhere?
<Architect> yes flat on the ground, preferably centered in the middle
<Builder> go it
<Architect> good job builder. i need a moment to inspect the structure.
<Architect> we will be removing this first layer in the future, but we need to build on top of it first.
<Architect> please place 2 red blocks on top of each side of the square, leaving the corners empty
<Architect> perfect.
<Builder> okay
<Architect> there is a 3rd layer that is floating, so please made a 6x6 square that extends upwards of 2 blocks to support the 3rd layer
<Architect> these will use purple blocks
<Builder> can you give me an instruction for a single purple block first?
<Architect> how about this, please make a 6x6 purple ring around the first layer of the red square
<Builder> okay
<Architect> yes, awesome. now place add another layer to that ring
<Architect> please*
<Builder> purple?
<Builder> i am out of blocks
<Architect> oh, do you have any colors that are not purple or red?
<Builder> yes
<Architect> ok, my mistake. i am a failure of an architect
<Architect> we will use other colors to support the final structure
<Builder> is the purple supposed to be on the third level?
<Builder> i think i could make it float..
<Architect> let's use blue to replace the purple ring. yes purple is supposed to be the final structure
<Builder> okay
<Builder> let me try it
<Architect> oh that is magnificent builder
<Architect> i am not familiar with minecraft, so my understanding is not as great as your own
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, we will need to cut some pieces form that and add a few but that is great.
<Architect> can you add purple blocks at each inner corner of that structure?
<Architect> if not, please remove the corner pieces of the purple ring
<Builder> i only have 20 blocks of each color. i used them up. okay i will remove some
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, all that's left now is removing
<Architect> we need to remove the pieces that were directly next to the old corners you just removed
<Builder> the purple ones?
<Architect> while leaving the new inner corners intact
<Architect> yes
<Architect> builder, you are awesome. now all we need to do is remove the first red layer and the structure should be complete. please standby for me to inspect at the end
<Builder> okay
<Builder> all of the first red layer?
<Architect> yes all of it
<Builder> is this it?
<Architect> yes, we've done it builder!
<Builder> good job!

<Architect> hello
<Builder> hello
<Architect> are u rdy to get to work?
<Builder> yes
<Architect> ok
<Architect> build a 2x1 structure that is blue
<Builder> is the structure extending upwards?
<Architect> no, it goes across
<Builder> is that good?
<Architect> now place 1 blue piece on the left block extending upwards
<Architect> yes that is correct
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes, now it is finished
<Builder> good job!
<Architect> you too builder

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> hello again builder
<Builder> hello
<Architect> we will start using green blocks
<Architect> i need you to build 4 green blocks straight from where you are standing, all on the ground
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now i need you to put a green block on either side of the second existing block, on the ground
<Builder> so on the middle blocks?
<Architect> they need to be attached to the same block, preferable to the one closer to you
<Architect> so it looks like a cross
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now, i need you to place a block diagonal from one of those new blocks, in the forward direction
<Builder> like a cactus?
<Architect> yes perfect
<Architect> now we are done with the green
<Architect> can you place a red block above the 4 greens with a space in between the green line and the new block?
<Builder> here?
<Architect> just need 1 block space in between the green and the new red block
<Builder> oh i see
<Architect> yes like that
<Architect> now can you place 4 yellow blocks on each flat side of the red block?
<Builder> its a flower!
<Architect> yes it is, you are very observant builder
<Architect> to finish, we need 4 orange blocks to fill in the corners of the 3x3 head of the flower
<Architect> good job builder, we have successfully completed our mission!
<Builder> good job!

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello. Whats our mission this time?
<Architect> we have a difficult one ahead of us this time builder. bear with me
<Builder> describe the structure?
<Architect> we will start using red blocks. if you recall from our previous mission we built an open 3x3 square as the second level of our "table
<Architect> this shape is now extending upwards instead of laying flat
<Builder> okay
<Architect> sort of like a window
<Builder> can i build anywhere?
<Architect> yes i think that will work
<Architect> now please place a red block on the left and right sides of the window, in the middle of each side
<Builder> these ones?
<Architect> yes place them adjacent to those you just removed
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> the second half of this structure is the same using purple blocks, but oriented differently. i will attempt to start you off step by step though
<Builder> so parallel?
<Builder> or perpendicular?
<Architect> it is attached to our current structure sort of parallel and rotated 90 degrees. anyway please place the first purple block on the rightmost red block
<Builder> is it connected?
<Architect> not quite
<Architect> its as if they were laying side by side and the purple one gets tilted up 90 degrees so it faces the sky
<Builder> oh so its on the ground?
<Architect> we can start off with the first few blocks and you will see soon
<Architect> the first purple block needs to be attached to the rightmost block, so that it hangs in the air and is closer to you
<Builder> here?
<Architect> if you move that block to the other side of that red block so that it is on your side and not just an extension
<Architect> yes
<Builder> is this the arm of the window?
<Architect> nowplease make the open square (window) on top of that new purple block
<Architect> yes it is
<Builder> is this good?
<Architect> ok builder i have bad news but it's an easy fix
<Architect> i gave you the wrong side
<Builder> on the back or other side?
<Architect> if you could do that exact structure so that its on the left side of the red square from where you were standing it will be correct
<Builder> here?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> is this it?
<Architect> good job builder, i am sorry for the incorrect instructions
<Architect> that is correct
<Builder> you did a good job!
<Architect> thank you for being my builder

B1-A3-rectangle-chain-1522433587517
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hello
<Architect> hello builder, we have yet another complicated structure. i will need a moment to look it over
<Builder> take your time. just give me instructions when you are ready.
<Architect> ok, we will start by using blue blocks. please start 1 square from the left side. we need to make a U shaped structure, but as if it were turned 90 degrees to the right and laying on its side
<Builder> start here?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> a C?
<Architect> i made a mistake, this will actually be a rectangle. you have started correctly. we need 2 more blue blocks going horizontally and finish it off by filling in the rectangle
<Architect> 2 more on the upper and lower part, i mean
<Builder> so the orientation is correct?
<Architect> 1 more, so that it is 4 across please. yes this orientation is correct i believe
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> yes, now we just need to fill in that last piece to complete the blue rectangle
<Architect> actually that is a little too far. we just need that middle block shifted to the left and to remove the other 2 ones you just placed
<Architect> it should be a 3x4 open rectangle
<Builder> what do you mean shifted to the left?
<Architect> there should be 2 open spaces in this rectangle
<Architect> it should end on the 4th block
<Architect> yes like that
<Builder> go it
<Builder> so re move the other 2 blue blocks at the end?
<Architect> yes please
<Architect> i will refer to this shape as r-windows from here on out. we need to make 3 more of them in different colors. the tricky part is they will all be interlinked. lets move on to the green one
<Builder> okay
<Architect> please place the first green block in the right open space of the blue r-window
<Builder> they are connected and all look the same right?
<Architect> some of them are oriented differently, flat instead of standing up
<Builder> okay. here?
<Architect> this one will be flat, but shifted up as if it were the second layer. yes that placement is corrent
<Builder> let me try
<Builder> like this?
<Builder> is the orientation correct?
<Architect> a good effort builder. we need this green one to be flat though. if you can shift it 90 degrees to the right then it will be perfect
<Builder> so flat?
<Architect> yes like that
<Architect> perfect. good job builder!
<Architect> one moment while i examine the strcuture
<Builder> okay
<Architect> next we need a purple r-window. it should be interlinked with the green and extending away from you. this one is not flat, much like the blue one
<Architect> yes like that
<Builder> extending like this?
<Architect> very good builder
<Builder> is that it?
<Builder> it might have been easier to describe the two windows first
<Builder> that are perpendicular
<Builder> then the interlocking one..
<Architect> a good point builder, i will try to do better in the future. our last r-window is red and oriented like the green one (flat). it should be interlinked with the purple r-window. it should extend to the left from where you are now
<Builder> like this?
<Architect> good job builder, that looks correct. please allow a moment to inspect the full structure
<Builder> okay
<Architect> i do believe we have successfully completed our mission. good job builder!
<Builder> good job

<Builder> hello. what are we building this time?
<Architect> hello builder, one moment
<Architect> ok, to get started we need to place 4 orange blocks as if they are the corners of a 3x3 square, all of them on the ground
<Builder> can i put them anywhere?
<Architect> yes, the rest of the structure extends upwards
<Architect> perfect
<Architect> one moment while i look at the structure
<Architect> the second level of the structure consists wholly of red blocks. start by putting a red block on each orange block
<Architect> good, now please fill in the outer sides of the second level 3x3 square but leave the middle open
<Architect> using red blocks
<Builder> okay
<Architect> good job builder, we have completed yet another flawless structure!
<Builder> its a table?
<Builder> good job

<Architect> yes
<Builder> how about that?
<Architect> terrific
<Architect> ok so now we are going to build a kind of ring around this square
<Architect> put green blocks next to the middle green blocks of the square
<Builder> ok, is it touching or space in between?
<Architect> great
<Architect> now add the green squares in the corner of the square
<Architect> the original square
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> excellent
<Architect> We are now switching to blue
<Builder> ok
<Architect> for the four squares that come out from the middle blocks, add two blue blocks on
<Architect> yeah great
<Architect> now for the ones that came out from the corner, you want to continue that diagonal with two more blue blocks
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> exactly
<Architect> beautiful

<Builder> oh my, well let's see what we can do about that
<Architect> ok start in the very center with one red block
<Architect> heart is perpendicular to the ground
<Architect> so we are going to need blue placeholders to the left and right of the base block
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> you got it
<Architect> do that twice more
<Architect> ok now you can get rid of the blue blocks
<Builder> ok
<Architect> build a red block on top of each of the top red blocks
<Architect> now build towards the center with two more red blocks per side

<Architect> and then another red one below that
<Architect> yep
<Architect> ok time to build the disease
<Builder> i am ready
<Architect> switch to orange
<Architect> place an orange block to the right of the base red block with two spaces in between
<Architect> nice
<Architect> now put one diagonally above to the left of that orange block
<Architect> and then do it again
<Architect> yes actually
<Architect> ok there is like a floating l to the upper left so now we are going to build that
<Builder> ok
<Architect> put two blue blocks on top of the upper left orange block
<Architect> now put two orange blocks to the left
<Architect> and one under the second one

<Builder> ok i don't know what that means but i trust you architect
<Architect> start with red blocks
<Architect> place them next to the top yellow blocks on the posts so they are on the inside of the bridge
<Architect> that wasn't clear sorry
<Builder> here?
<Architect> oh yeah great
<Architect> ok we are going to need a placeholder block so use green or blue
<Builder> roger that
<Architect> cool, put it right below all of the red blocks you just added
<Architect> great, now add another red block next to each green one
<Architect> yep
<Architect> add another green block below each red one you added
<Architect> then connect across with two red blocks
<Architect> what a masterpiece!
<Builder> wait
<Builder> i think i messed up
<Architect> lols yeah the one side is correct
<Architect> yay!
<Builder> we good now?
