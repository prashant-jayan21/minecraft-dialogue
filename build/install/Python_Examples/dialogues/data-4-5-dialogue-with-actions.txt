<Architect> yes exactly! ok now delete the boxes underneath, leaving only the steps
<Builder> so far we've built an L, a large duck, a funky staircase, and a cube shaped house. How would you describe the end goal of this build?
<Architect> abstract. there are a lot of stair type pieces in red yellow and orange
<Builder> cool, that might help, maybe...haha
<Architect> lol. ok now delete the bottom pieces of the stairs leaving only the parts you would use for steps
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a yellow block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]

<Architect> ok now 4 blocks to the left and 3 blocks forward place a red blocks
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> yes!
<Architect> now it will be a diagonal staircase with 4 steps angling towards the middle
<Architect> if that makes sense
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
<Builder> diagonal staircase with this orientation?

<Architect> Great!
<Architect> Okay so now we have to build a similar structure again haha
<Architect> It is perpendicular to this one. It is blue. If you are facing the yellow part of the other structure, the base will be parallel to the yellow, separated by two spaces and one space to the right.
<Architect> Sorry, hard to describe, just put some down and I will correct if necessary...

<Architect> Okay. This one can be described as two parts. i'll start with one part, which is entirely red blocks.
<Architect> start with three red blocks next to one another
<Builder> how much space do i need to leave on the whole grid
<Architect> the whold thing is only two columns, 6 rows and then built vertically
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> cool.
<Architect> now put a red block on top of each end
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> yep. now, adjacent to the left and right of the ones you just put down, attach a red
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:4 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> yep! now put a row of three red on the top and in the middle
<Builder> on top and in the middle?
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:3 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:3 Z:-3]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yes, that's it
<Architect> the second structure will be "behind" this one, with respect to you right now
<Architect> this one is purple. Start with a purple right under you, but flush with the red strdcuture
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> one to the left, my b
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
<Architect> place a row of three purple on top of that, symmetrically
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-3]
<Architect> of wait shoot. shift all the purples up one unit vertically

[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:-2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Builder> this?
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> then blocks on top of each end
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:4 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:4 Z:-2]
<Architect> a row of three on top of that
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:6 Z:-2]
<Architect> and one in the middle
<Architect> perfect
<Builder> great
<Builder> that it?
<Architect> one sec. i'm checking to see if it's rotation invariant
<Architect> okay its right

B20-A10-rectangle-chain-1522941513644
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this entire structure lays on/above a footprint of a 7 by 6 gird
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> im just marking for myself
<Architect> actually, that is a really good start
<Architect> start from the top blck and make a row toward the other of four purple blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> fill in underthat as well.
<Builder> tok
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-1]
<Architect> and another row on top of that of purple
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:-1]
<Architect> and you can remove taht other one
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> okay. so on right end of the strucure, on the second level, there are red blocks kind of making a ring off the end. So i would start with a red block second from the right on the second levle of this purple thing
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> one more in the same direction
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> lay two to the right of that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> now three going up from that
[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> and two more wrapping around the purple
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:0]
<Architect> yep! next lets do the green blocks.
<Architect> okay, so basically the same thing happens on the second level with the green. except the ring is bigger on your side
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:1]
<Architect> yep!
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]

[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:0 Y:2 Z:3]
<Architect> okay, quick change. the blocks you can't "see" in the original purple rectangle shouldnt be there.
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> or, morethey should be replaced with red and green to continue the rectangles youre building around them
<Builder> ah okay
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a green block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:1]
<Architect> great!
<Architect> the final is a blue rectangle, like the ones you just build
<Architect> *built
<Builder> where do I put it?
<Architect> it is perpindicular to the purple and green
<Architect> so start in the empty spot of the green rectangle,
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> one blue on top of that
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> three more toward you
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> two down
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-5 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> fill in the rest? or is it a ring?
<Architect> and then connect itwith three more back toward the start
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a blue block at X:-4 Y:1 Z:2]

B20-A10-scissors-1522942426640
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, so the footprint of this is just 1 by 7
<Architect> then it is built vertically from there
<Architect> it is floating, so you'll need to put some blocks down to have a starting point
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:-3]
<Architect> put a row of three orange blocks down
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:1 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:0 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a orange block at X:2 Y:2 Z:-3]
