[Builder puts down a red block at X:0 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> then delete the base
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:0 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:1 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:3]
<Architect> nvm sorry that wasnt the last thing
<Architect> the red top is a v shape
<Architect> so the next row on top of the red block
<Architect> should have two blocks
<Architect> with one horizontal space between them
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:6 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:5 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:5 Z:3]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> now another row except with three horizontal spaces
<Builder> got it
[Builder puts down a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:1 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:7 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-1 Y:7 Z:3]
<Architect> ok now this is the last row, same thing except with 5 horizontal spaces
[Builder puts down a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:8 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:2 Y:8 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:8 Z:3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-2 Y:8 Z:3]
<Architect> ok now we're done
<Builder> great

B4-A19-spectacles-1522883588233
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi
<Architect> ok get some purple blocks
<Architect> ok so lets think of this like a coordinate system
<Architect> place a purple block in x = 3, y =4
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> now x = 4, y=4
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> x = 5, y = 4
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> ok nvm can't use coordinates
<Builder> you could just say a line too
<Architect> place one to the right one spot of the block
<Architect> you just placed
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> one space in between
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:0 Y:1 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> ok now two blocks directly to the right of the one you just placed
<Architect> in the same row
<Builder> as in two spaces with one blank space or two blank spaces?
<Architect> no spaces
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:1 Z:2]
<Architect> yeah now anotehr block to the right
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:1 Z:2]
<Builder> oh another line of three
<Architect> ok yeah thats a better way to say it
<Architect> ok so on top place purple blocks alternating
<Architect> so one on each end of the line of 3
<Architect> they are floating
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> yeah like taht
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> oh no what you were doing before was right
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> i meant theyre just not on the ground
<Builder> ok
<Architect> like the side on your left
[Builder picks up a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> ok now the next row should be completely filled, 7 blocks
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:0 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:2 Y:3 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:3 Y:3 Z:2]
<Architect> ok now think of a window
<Architect> youre missing a block in z = 1
<Architect> on the 3rd block of each side
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:1 Y:2 Z:2]
[Builder puts down a purple block at X:-1 Y:2 Z:2]
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> ok now get some red blocks
<Architect> so for the very top row
<Architect> extend the blocks on each end
<Architect> by adding 4 blocks in the air
<Architect> extend them in the perpendicular direction
<Builder> a floating line?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> behind the purple structure
<Architect> in the front
<Architect> wherever there is more space
<Builder> jutting out from the upper corner purple one
<Architect> yea
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> both sides?
<Architect> yep
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:0]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-1]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:3 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok now make a diagonal line from the last red blocks of each line to the ground
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:1 Z:-3]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> for the other side too
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-3]
[Builder puts down a red block at X:-3 Y:1 Z:-4]
[Builder picks up a red block at X:-3 Y:2 Z:-2]
<Architect> ok done
<Builder> cool
