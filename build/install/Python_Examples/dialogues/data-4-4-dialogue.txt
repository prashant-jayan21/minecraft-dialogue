<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one is a spiral. start on the right edge, and build a 9 block line going left in green
<Architect> now 9 green blocks up on teh left side (8 new ones)
<Architect> okay now a line going right and red, to the end of the green line
<Architect> now red goes down, but leave a space above the green block
<Architect> purple left, leaving a space before the green line
<Architect> yellow is the next l
<Architect> two orange blocks right and then taht's it
<Architect> left sorry
<Architect> that's it!
<Builder> knew what you meant

B11-A7-butterfly-1522857006209
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one's like a butterfly when you look at it form the top
<Builder> ok, thanks
<Architect> but it's going to be built in the air
<Builder> so all on one horizontal plane, but floating?
<Architect> not quite all in one horizontal plane but more or less
<Builder> ok.
<Architect> the first purple block is going to be closer to your side of the box and about cells up?
<Builder> how many cells up?
<Architect> yes, but get rid of the bottom two blocks
<Architect> and i think maybe go one more up?
<Architect> cool that's right
<Builder> great. Should we maybe build the others on this "floor" next?
<Architect> now that's the bottom of a line of four blocks going away from you
<Architect> and yes, sounds good
<Architect> now there's a blue block one up and to the left
<Architect> not up, away from you
<Builder> floating?
<Architect> and one more in teh same direction
<Architect> okay apparently we should shift this all down by one
<Builder> ok, that should be it. Everything's on the third level now
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> now a symmetric blue antenna on the other side
<Architect> now on either side of the third purple block away from you, put an orange block
<Architect> that's everything on this level
<Architect> one level up, we're going to have an orange block twoards you and right from the last block you placed
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes, and then the same thing but away from you on the same side
<Architect> and then symmetric on the left
<Architect> now up one more level
<Architect> on the left side, you're going to build a line of five blocks to the left of the blocks you just built
<Builder> also orange?
<Architect> liek that, and then symmetric on the other side
<Architect> that's it!

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> start with a 5x4 blue rectangle
<Architect> don't fill it in
<Architect> pick a side to stand on
<Builder> south side
<Architect> third block away from you on the left side is actually yellow
<Architect> and fourth block to the right on your side is yellow
<Architect> now fill in the blocks right next to the two yellow blocks as yello
<Architect> and the rest of the middle is blue
<Architect> build a yellow block on top of each edge yellow block
<Architect> and then a yellow block out of the rectangle next to each of those
<Architect> that's it!

B11-A7-pickup_truck-1522855627706
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> so this one is kind of like a truck or a dog or something
<Builder> ok. so four legs/wheels?
<Architect> yes, put four blue blocks on the corners of a 4x3 rectangle
<Architect> now we're going to put a 5x3 red rectangle on top of that
<Architect> 6x3 actually
<Builder> ok. sticking out one on each side?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> filled in?
<Architect> sticking out in the other dimension
<Architect> and yes, filled in
<Builder> thanks
<Architect> go to the left side and face the shape from there
<Architect> put a yellow on the leftmost red block and the rightmost
<Architect> and a green in the middle
<Architect> now put 3 green blocks on top of those
<Architect> those three green blocks are the side of a 3x3 square
<Architect> that sits on top of the red blocks
<Builder> that lays flat?
<Architect> yes
<Builder> filled in?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> face the front of the truck again
<Architect> and put three red blocks on top of the middle row
<Builder> I'll assume all polygons are filled in from now on
<Architect> sorry green
<Builder> i'm out of red blocks
<Architect> put orange behind the left and right of the blocks you just placed
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes except i made a mistake. There's not green block between the two orange blocks on the bottom layer of the square
<Builder> ok, did I clean it up correctly?
<Architect> yes, i think that's it

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> this one doesn't really look like anything, it's just super snakey
<Builder> ok. maybe back to coordinates?
<Architect> put a yellow block in one corner of the square
<Architect> okay let's call that square the bottom left corner
<Builder> ok
<Architect> (0,0)
<Builder> does the whole thing stay on the ground/
<Builder> ?
<Architect> yellow blocks at (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1)
<Architect> no unfortunately
<Architect> on the right most block put a yellow block on top of that
<Architect> and go right one more
<Architect> now forward one
<Builder> i'll face the same way as much as possible so relative directions work well
<Architect> and two more in the same direction
<Architect> put two blocks on top of the last block you built
<Architect> one right
<Architect> one up
<Architect> on right
<Architect> one right from the last thing you built
<Architect> one up
<Architect> now build two towards you
<Architect> one to the right
<Architect> one up
<Architect> one away from you
<Builder> that's my last yellow
<Architect> now we're going to switch to green
<Builder> ready
<Architect> i think something might be wrong, give me a second to check
<Builder> ok.
<Architect> okay never mind it's fine
<Builder> great
<Architect> build one block right of the last block you built
<Architect> another block right
<Builder> feel free to give more than one direction at a time if you're comfortable
<Builder> e.g. one right, then one up
<Architect> one down, and then i have to check to see whats going on
<Architect> one more down, then one away from you
<Architect> down and away from you again
<Architect> then down and right
<Architect> i think that's it, i'm going to check really quickly
<Builder> sounds good
<Architect> yeah look good

<Architect> and orange on top of that
<Architect> now build the leg on the other side of the red block, symmetric to the first leg
<Builder> arms?
<Architect> yep! on the fourth red block put a gree block on the right
<Architect> left
<Architect> sorry
<Builder> my left?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now one green block diagonal up
<Architect> now on the other side one green block next to the same red block
<Architect> not quite, the last one is diagonal towards you instead of diagonal up
<Builder> tricky
<Architect> it's not up at all

<Architect> and build six red blocks in a line upwards
<Architect> the top block is the middle of a five cube line that extends to your right and left
<Architect> second to top is the same but a 3 cube line
<Architect> now there's a three cube orange line on top of the long red line, centered the same
<Architect> on the right two blocks build two more orange blocks up

<Architect> i think you're going to have to move the x one block left to fit it
<Architect> okay the = sign is also floating one block in the air and it's yellow
<Architect> it's two blocks long
<Architect> with one block betwee the top and bottom line
<Architect> one space between the x and =

<Architect> and put another green block on top of each of those!
<Architect> now remove all the bottom blocks
<Architect> alright, now, put a yellow block above the second green block from your left
<Architect> and put another yellow block in front of it, towards your current position
<Architect> and delete the first yellow block
<Architect> okay, now, make a row of 4 yellow blocks, with 1-space gaps in between, towards you
<Architect> so perpendicular to the green blocks :)
<Builder> where's the starting point for the row
<Architect> the first yellow block, sorry
<Architect> looks good! it only needs 4 blocks though, so delete that last one
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now, on top of the 2nd closest yellow block to the green ones, put an orange block
<Builder> there?
<Architect> yep!
<Architect> and make a 1-gap row of three orange blocks, perpendicular to the green ones
<Architect> on the side you're currently on
<Architect> yeah, that side
<Builder> on top of the yellow blocks?
<Architect> no, parallel to the green ones
<Architect> yeah like that!
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now put a red block right next to the last orange one, in the same direction
<Architect> put another red one on top of that
<Architect> and three more below it so it touches the ground
<Architect> now remove the 2nd block from the bottom
<Architect> and the 2nd from the top

<Architect> perfect
<Architect> now move to the other side of the structure
<Architect> sorry, trying to figure out how to explain this
<Architect> okay, stand right there and face right
<Architect> put a green block three spaces in front of you
<Builder> there?
<Architect> now another on top of that
<Architect> now two green blocks on either side, paralell to the orange pyramid
<Architect> whoops, my bad
<Architect> those should both be connected to the top block
<Architect> alright, now two more green blocks extending to the right of the top row
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now remove the bottom block
<Architect> and build the exact same pyramid structure on top of those green blocks
<Architect> so it should look like the orange one
<Builder> is that good?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> okay, so now, place a red block on top and in front of the topmost green block, from your current perspective
<Builder> there?
<Architect> no, sorry, the top of the pyramid
<Architect> start with a red block on top of the pyramid
<Architect> like that, but on the other side!
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now extend that to a row of 5 red blocks, making a line towards the orange pyramid
<Architect> okay, now, you're gonna want to build an UPSIDE DOWN pyramid structure
<Architect> so just like the other two, but upside down
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yes, perfect!
<Builder> solid
<Architect> i messed up though
<Architect> i apologized
<Architect> the orange pyramid should be one tile to the right of where it currently is, so it's directly underneath the red pyramid's ip
<Architect> tip*
<Builder> aight
<Architect> no
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> move one space left
<Architect> walk up against the orange pyramid
<Architect> okay, place an orange block right in front of you
<Architect> and one space down

<Architect> does the building grid look white to you?
<Architect> the first one was right!
<Builder> yeah
<Builder> there?
<Architect> only the block closer to the grid edge needs to be there
<Architect> the other one doesn't
<Architect> perfect! :)
<Builder> ok cool
<Architect> now, put another red block so that it's halfway between the current red and blue one
<Architect> one space higher, so it's touching the blue one
<Architect> yeah! :)
<Architect> now, if you can imagine a tripod, you'll want two yellow blocks in the reverse pattern of the red ones
<Architect> yeah on that side :)
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now, make a tower of two more blue blocks on top of the first one
<Architect> and a purple one on top of that

<Architect> good!
<Architect> this is hard to describe
<Architect> you'll want another yellow block above, in front of, and to the right of the current one
<Architect> from the perspective of where you currenrtly are
<Architect> perfect!
<Architect> now place one more yellow block in that exact same trajectory
<Architect> so that its corners touch the highest yellow and green blocks
<Architect> whoops, sorry, that was unclear

<Architect> it's a 3X3 griod
<Architect> grid*
<Architect> with a red block in the center
<Architect> now yellow blocks on the sides and orange blocks on the diagonal
<Architect> okay were done

<Architect> okay
<Architect> we want to build a right angle in orange blocks
<Architect> yeah and then one more
<Builder> up?
<Architect> on the ground
<Architect> yes

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> starting in one corner of the space on the ground
<Architect> place an orange block
<Architect> now diagonally above and to the right
<Architect> so up 1 over 1
<Builder> orange?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> on the same x axis
<Architect> now from that block
<Architect> place another block on the end closest to you
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now a two more extending towards you
<Architect> yes, now the rest is symmetric
<Architect> to the left sorry
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> okay now on the middle block of the line of three place a green block
<Architect> on the same plane
<Architect> now another diaginally up and away from the orange structure
<Architect> yes, now another one
<Architect> hahaha okay so we have to move what we just built over two to the right
<Builder> my right as I stand?
<Architect> I was building the mirror image...
<Architect> sorry facing from the orange to the green
<Architect> as if you were behind the orange
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> shift the whole thing two spaces to the right as I stand?
<Builder> orange and green blocks?
<Architect> yes
<Architect> yes
<Builder> remind me please I can't believe I forgot...
<Architect> one behind the line of three
<Builder> Anjali took some cycles
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> okay now with purple
<Architect> on the far edge of the ground
<Architect> sorry the edge to your right
<Architect> four blocks to the left from this corner
<Architect> place a purple block on the ground
<Architect> now another purple
<Architect> up and towards the green blocks
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now forward two and over three on the ground
<Architect> place red block
<Architect> sorry
<Architect> yeah there
<Architect> now place another red up and over to the left
<Architect> yes

B29-A8-random_objects_2-1522862991223
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> start with a yellow tower of six
<Architect> three blocks from an edge
<Architect> we will run out of space
<Architect> now three blocks over from the top
<Architect> like a gate
<Architect> to your right
<Architect> in yellow
<Architect> three blocks of space sorry
<Architect> connect the topmost blocks
<Architect> yes
<Architect> okay now on the ground
<Architect> place a red block back one and over one from the first tower
<Builder> over?
<Architect> to the right
<Architect> yes
<Architect> now a two block tower to the right of that
<Architect> right again and back another red block
<Architect> and diagonally back again
<Architect> and one more block just back
<Architect> now on the blocknext to the top of the red tower
<Architect> beneath the gate
<Architect> an orange block
<Architect> now a diagonal line extending three block up out and to the left
<Architect> yes

B29-A8-table2-1522860695010
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> okay, place four orange blocks at the corners of a 3X3 grid
<Architect> on the ground
<Architect> now above that place red blocks on the grid
<Builder> above?
<Architect> yeah, like a line
<Architect> above the orange blocks you just placed
<Architect> yes
<Architect> no center block sorry
<Architect> yes

B4-A19-3d-triangle-1522884961579
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get some blue blocks
<Architect> ok place then in a diagonal
<Architect> 3 blue blocks
<Architect> on the ground
<Architect> ok now red blocks
<Architect> place 2 diagonally from the last blue block on the ground
<Architect> to the left
<Architect> should be connected to the blue block
<Builder> continuing the line?
<Architect> diagonally connected
<Architect> uh no on the otehr side
<Architect> flipped
<Architect> no on the other corner
<Architect> yeah there
<Architect> ok place a line of yellow blocks connecting the red and blue blocks on each side
<Architect> uh right below you
<Builder> horizontal or vertical?
<Architect> horizontal
<Architect> oh they should be one row above
<Builder> floating?
<Architect> no one horizontal row above
<Architect> no on the other side
<Architect> there should be 5 blocks on the other side sorry
<Builder> other side of what?
<Architect> right below you
<Architect> line of 5 blocks
<Architect> ok now place green blocks on top of all the yellow blocks
<Architect> purple blocks on top of all the red blocks
<Architect> then orange blocks on top of all the blue blocks
<Architect> ok that seems to be good
<Builder> great

B4-A19-concentric_semicircles-1522883113537
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get some yellow blocks
<Architect> in the center of the row, there's a floating block with z=1
<Architect> like in the xyz coordinate plane
<Builder> center of which row?
<Architect> we only need one entire row for this
<Architect> so it doesn't matter which row
<Architect> yeah now place two on the sides except they're on the ground, z = 0
<Architect> ok so now two units from each yellow block on the ground, place a purple block
<Architect> now place two purple blocks like before, except two units away from the yellow floating block
<Architect> meaning z =1
<Builder> on top of the other purples?
<Architect> uh no right next to the ones you just placed, one horizontal space
<Builder> so connecting the purple and yellow diagonally?
<Architect> yea
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> then 3 purple stacked horizontally on top of the yellow floating block
<Architect> the on the very ends place red blocks
<Architect> the row ends
<Builder> of which row?
<Architect> the same row
<Architect> oh sorry i meant on the ground
<Architect> not conected to the other blocks
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> so like the yellow and the purple stack diagonally
<Architect> stack the red ones diagonally in the air
<Builder> okay how many?
<Architect> till z = 4
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> then place 3 red ones directly on top ot the purple ones directly on top
<Architect> ok we're done
<Builder> nice

B4-A19-creative-five-1522885325283
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get a green block
<Architect> place it anywhere
<Architect> place a blue block next to it
<Architect> doesnt matter where
<Architect> just next to it
<Architect> ok horizontally on top of the blue block place a purple block
<Architect> so like one row up
<Builder> but still aligned with blue?
<Architect> yea
<Architect> place another purple on top of the purple thats here
<Architect> floating
<Architect> or i mean stacked
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> and then another purple stacked
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> now a yellow block conncted to that purple and directly above the blue
<Architect> now an orange connected to the yellow and above the green
<Architect> now stack an orange on that orange
<Architect> do it again
<Architect> now a blue on top of the yellow and connected to that orange
<Builder> on top of the yellow or with a space btw?
<Architect> with a space btw
<Architect> ok now a red connected to that blue and above the purple
<Architect> ok thats good

<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi
<Architect> can you get some red blocks
<Architect> place one anywhere on the ground
<Architect> place a yellow one three units to your right
<Architect> sorry mb actually one more unit over
<Architect> tthen four units up from the yellow and two units to the left of the yellow, place a green block
<Architect> get a red block
<Architect> place it diagonal to the red block except it should be floating
<Builder> towards which direction?
<Architect> uh towards the center of the triangle that the three blocks make
<Builder> there?
<Architect> yeah now do the same for the other two colored blocks
<Builder> with red or their own colors?
<Architect> their own colors and directed towards the center
<Architect> now in the center and three units above, place a blue block
<Architect> ok now stack two blue blocks on top of that blue one
<Architect> ok get some purple blocks, we will make a Y shape
<Architect> so the center of the yshape should be on top of blue
<Architect> so just place one there for now
<Architect> extend that 2 blocks out toward the side with red and yellow
<Architect> now diagonal to the center purple block place two purple blocks, one on each side
<Architect> diagonally
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> oh no i mean the purple block on top of the blue block
<Architect> so basically diagonal to the purple on top of the blue
<Builder> there are diagonal. which direction should they point?
<Architect> toward the side with green
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> so make a Y shape
<Builder> how many>
<Builder> ?
<Architect> just one more row
<Architect> ok done
<Builder> phew
<Architect> yep

B4-A19-flower_new-1522882189483
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok now the mission has started
<Architect> get some green blocks
<Architect> place one two blocks up from the bottom
<Builder> floating?
<Architect> ok now place one one square up
<Architect> none of them float
<Architect> ok now place two on each side
<Architect> of the one you just placed
<Architect> oh i meant one on each side sorry
<Builder> np
<Architect> now place one up
<Builder> above the original line?
<Architect> yea
<Architect> place another one up
<Architect> ok then place one on each side of the previous one
<Architect> not the one you just placed
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> uh there should be a one block space between the ones on the side and the one in the middle
<Architect> so like removve the two blocks you placed
<Builder> ?
<Architect> yea
<Architect> like that
<Architect> then get some yellow blocks
<Builder> is it a flower?
<Architect> yea
<Architect> a 3 by 3 square on top
<Architect> yellow on the sides
<Architect> orange in the corners
<Architect> and red in the middle
<Architect> in the very center
<Architect> yea
<Builder> cool

B4-A19-hot-1522884235745
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok we're creating shapes of the letters hot
<Architect> and they're floating
<Architect> so get some blue blocks
<Architect> so one square from the edge
<Architect> and three units up
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yeah so each letter is basically a 3 by 3 square with some squares missing
<Architect> and they start one unit up, not two units up
<Builder> there's only one blank space underneath?
<Architect> so basically just move that one down one row
<Architect> yeah sory
<Architect> ok make this the letter H
<Architect> ok now two rows down from the H
<Architect> get some orange blocks
<Builder> behind it from where i'm facing?
<Architect> like behind the H
<Architect> yea
<Builder> one blank row?
<Architect> yeah and start 4 squares in
<Architect> yea
<Architect> make an O
<Builder> good?
<Architect> uh so this is actually the mirror image of the actual mission
<Architect> so the H should be behind the O
<Architect> from the direction you're facing
<Builder> okay
<Architect> not directly behind
<Architect> it should be one square in
<Architect> so form that side
<Architect> your right
<Builder> there?
<Architect> uh you should start one from the right not 3 from the right
<Builder> there?
<Architect> yea
<Architect> yep
<Builder> good
<Architect> ok now do the same thing for T
<Architect> in front of hte O
<Architect> green blocks
<Builder> there?
<Architect> uh move it two squares to the right
<Builder> there?
<Architect> uh actually one square to the left now
<Architect> yeah there
<Architect> ok done

<Builder> hello
<Architect> t
<Architect> hi
<Builder> what's our mission?
<Architect> im not sure yet

B4-A19-scissors-1522882673164
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get some blocks
<Architect> doesnt mamtter which
<Architect> cause this structure floats
<Architect> so as a base put a line of 7 blocks
<Architect> then get some orange blocks, these will be in the actual structure
<Architect> put three on one end
<Architect> two on the other end
<Builder> stacked vertically?
<Architect> horizontally
<Architect> then put a block every other square on top of this row, starting from each end
<Architect> so the next row should have 4 blocks in alternating spots
<Builder> are some of them floating?
<Architect> uhyeah one of them floats
<Builder> like that?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> then the next row, fill the entire row with blocks
<Architect> so 7 blocks
<Builder> color?
<Architect> oh yeah all should be orange, including the row you just made
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> then the very last row has a red block in the very center
<Architect> then delete the base
<Architect> nvm sorry that wasnt the last thing
<Architect> the red top is a v shape
<Architect> so the next row on top of the red block
<Architect> should have two blocks
<Architect> with one horizontal space between them
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> now another row except with three horizontal spaces
<Builder> got it
<Architect> ok now this is the last row, same thing except with 5 horizontal spaces
<Architect> ok now we're done
<Builder> great

B4-A19-spectacles-1522883588233
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Builder> hi
<Architect> hi
<Architect> ok get some purple blocks
<Architect> ok so lets think of this like a coordinate system
<Architect> place a purple block in x = 3, y =4
<Architect> now x = 4, y=4
<Architect> x = 5, y = 4
<Architect> ok nvm can't use coordinates
<Builder> you could just say a line too
<Architect> place one to the right one spot of the block
<Architect> you just placed
<Architect> one space in between
<Architect> ok now two blocks directly to the right of the one you just placed
<Architect> in the same row
<Builder> as in two spaces with one blank space or two blank spaces?
<Architect> no spaces
<Architect> yeah now anotehr block to the right
<Builder> oh another line of three
<Architect> ok yeah thats a better way to say it
<Architect> ok so on top place purple blocks alternating
<Architect> so one on each end of the line of 3
<Architect> they are floating
<Architect> yeah like taht
<Architect> oh no what you were doing before was right
<Architect> i meant theyre just not on the ground
<Builder> ok
<Architect> like the side on your left
<Architect> ok now the next row should be completely filled, 7 blocks
<Architect> ok now think of a window
<Architect> youre missing a block in z = 1
<Architect> on the 3rd block of each side
<Architect> yeah
<Architect> ok now get some red blocks
<Architect> so for the very top row
<Architect> extend the blocks on each end
<Architect> by adding 4 blocks in the air
<Architect> extend them in the perpendicular direction
<Builder> a floating line?
<Architect> yeah
<Builder> behind the purple structure
<Architect> in the front
<Architect> wherever there is more space
<Builder> jutting out from the upper corner purple one
<Architect> yea
<Architect> yeah like that
<Builder> both sides?
<Architect> yep
<Architect> ok now make a diagonal line from the last red blocks of each line to the ground
<Architect> yeah like that
<Architect> for the other side too
<Architect> ok done
<Builder> cool

B4-A19-table2-1522882559576
<Builder> Mission has started.
<Architect> ok get some orange blocks
<Architect> ok place four in the corners of a 3 by 3 square
<Architect> only in the corners
<Architect> then place red blocks in a 3 by 3 square right on top
<Architect> with the center missing
<Architect> k thats it
<Architect> next mission
<Builder> easy
